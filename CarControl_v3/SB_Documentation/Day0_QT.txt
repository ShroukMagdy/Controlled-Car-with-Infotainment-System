follow last replies steps
1. Update your raspberry pi -
Code: Select all

sudo apt-get update
2. Upgrade your raspberry pi -
Code: Select all

sudo apt-get upgrade
3. Install Qt - (I have used Qt5) -
Code: Select all

sudo apt-get install qt5-default
4. Install Qt creator -

sudo apt-get install qtcreator
5. Open Qtcreator and go to Help > about plugins and and untick Remote Linux
6. Restart your raspberry pi
7. Again open Qt creator, go to "Tools > Options > Build and Run" and go to Compilers. Add "GCC" set compiler path as /usr/bin/gcc
8. Normally Qt version and Debugger will be automatically set, but you can also set them
9. Then go to Kits (Still inside the Build and Run) and check whether Compiler, Debugger and Qt version are set
10. That's it , click Ok and create a new project

I just add that I got this up from the instructions above but also needed to `sudo apt-get install qtdeclarative5-dev` to get the default Qt apps to build.

note : depending on the untick of remote linux the Qnx lib is removed ,we don't know if it is useful
