create objects like pushbuttons
---------------------------------
in file.ui --> add pushbutton
connect the pushbutton with its press and release with slot 
(slot is added as method in file.h)
connect(ui->pushButton,SIGNAL(pressed()),this,SLOT(click_increment()));

connect(ui->pushButton,SIGNAL(released()),this,SLOT(click_stop()));


create objects like timer
--------------------------
include QTimer.h
connect(timer,SIGNAL(timeout()),this,SLOT(timer_increment()));
start timer by number of ticks
after timeout -- the method in slot is executed

there is another type of timer 
qtimerelapsed ---> used to know the elapsed time
no need to start with ticks --> ust start

Pi control

include wiringpi.h
in file.pro 
LIBS += -L/usr/local/include -lwiringPi

call wiringsetup - and pins setup like direction
